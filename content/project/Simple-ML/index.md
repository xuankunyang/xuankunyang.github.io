# TripDataset Machine Learning Project

This project is a complete implementation of machine learning pipelines applied to the TripDataset, focusing on data preprocessing, classification, and regression tasks, including:

- 🧹 Data preprocessing and cleaning (handling missing values, outlier detection, normalization, and feature engineering)

- 🤖 Model training for classification and regression (various ML algorithms for categorical and continuous prediction tasks)

- 📊 Performance evaluation and metrics (accuracy, F1-score, RMSE, and other evaluation techniques)

- 🔍 Exploratory data analysis and visualization (insightful plots for feature relationships, distribution, and model performance)
